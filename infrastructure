#Problem 1: Wrong google search
#The goal is to deploy an nginx server on ubuntu that reverse proxies google.com but with a catch.
#Every search that includes "rockets" should be turned into search about "Relativity Space". If I go to this server in my browser
#I will be presented with google's page and if I search for "rockets" I should get results about "Relativity Space".
#  -I should be able to run your submitted script on an ubuntu box with admin access and then hit localhost and get the google page
#  (It should include downloading and installing nginx and then configuring it to do reverse proxy).
#  -It doesn't need to support https - http is fine.
#  - Bonus points for deploying the ubuntu image with your reverse proxy as a docker image in docker hub.
#
#Problem 2: PowerShell deleter
#The goal is to write a PowerShell script that accepts three parameters from command line.
#First is an absolute path to a folder and next two are dates in following format: 'HH mm yyyy dd MM'.
#The script should then recursively look in all the folders within the path provided and delete files that have been
#created between the first date and second date, and also contain the word "Copy" in their name.

# Solution:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install nginx


sudo tee /etc/nginx/sites-available/default <<EOF
